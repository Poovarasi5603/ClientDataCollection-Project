# ClientDataCollection-Project

**Getting Started**
--------------------------

Gathering the client information, write it to the structured text file using C++ programming language.

By using file system 'ofstream' to open a text file in write mode.

Create a function that allows users to input client information, This function can use cin or other input methods to gather data.

By using file system 'ifstream' to read a text file in read mode .

View the consolidated client information that stored in text file using Quincy 2005 IDE by MinGW C++ compiler and GDB debugger.

**Display the content through PHP :**

To read a text file and display its contents through PHP using XAMPP Web Server.

Move the text file into the "htdocs" directory of your XAMPP installation. This directory is typically located at C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows or /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs on macOS.

Create a new PHP file in the "htdocs" directory 'client.php' that contains php code to read the text file's contents.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/php_program/client.php . This will execute the PHP script, read the contents of the text file, and display them on the web page.

Ensure that XAMPP is running and Apache is started so that you can access your PHP files through the localhost server.
